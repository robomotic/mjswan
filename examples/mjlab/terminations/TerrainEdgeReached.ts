/**
 * Terminate when the robot's displacement from its spawn origin exceeds
 * the sub-terrain boundary (intended as a curriculum success signal).
 *
 * Mirrors mjlab's ``terrain_edge_reached``. The sub-terrain half-extents are
 * pre-computed at Python build time from ``TerrainGeneratorCfg.size`` and
 * injected as ``half_x`` / ``half_y``. The threshold fraction is read from the
 * config params when present.
 *
 * The spawn origin is captured from the first post-reset root position, so the
 * browser-side implementation does not need Python to build an extra scene just
 * to resolve env origins.
 *
 * The first two steps after reset are skipped to avoid stale-position
 * triggers — matching the mjlab implementation.
 *
 * If the params are absent (e.g. no terrain generator), the termination
 * never fires.
